# NEON_DataAnalysis

This script will use the NEONUtilities package to download NEON dissolved gas data, filter out low quality observations, calculate intial aqueous concentrations, propagate error from reported measurement errors, and average replicates collected on the same day.  Please work through the code line by line, as some quality control decisions are subjective and must be determined by the user.
